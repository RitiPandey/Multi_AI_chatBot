## üìå Problem Statement
Building a **multi-AI chatbot** that integrates **Contentstack CMS** and multiple LLMs (OpenAI, Gemini, Groq).  
The chatbot should fetch FAQs and content dynamically from Contentstack and answer user queries in real time.  

Key Features:

## üí° Abstract
In businesses and customer support, FAQs are mostly static.  
We aimed to create a **dynamic chatbot** that:  
1. Fetches FAQs from Contentstack.  
2. Enhances responses using AI models (OpenAI, Gemini, Groq).  
3. Provides a plug-and-play SDK for client integration.  

This makes customer interaction more **efficient, real-time, and scalable**.
